# Agent Backends

The factory supports five AI backends for executing WOs. Four are subscription-based CLI tools that run on your host machine. One calls the Anthropic API directly from Docker. Enable only the ones you use — **Settings → Agents → LLM Providers** controls which are active in your factory.

## The five backends

| Backend | How it runs | What you need |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `claude` | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` CLI | Claude Pro or Max subscription + CLI logged in |
| `cursor` | `cursor --headless` CLI | Cursor Pro subscription + CLI logged in |
| `codex` | `codex --approval-mode full-auto` CLI | OpenAI Codex subscription |
| `gemini` | `gemini --yolo -p` CLI | Google Gemini Advanced subscription |
| `claude-api` | Anthropic SDK inside Docker | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the secrets vault |

The subscription backends run on your host machine and use your existing CLI session credentials. Docker never touches those credentials. The draft server on port 8101 is the bridge: the orchestrator calls `http://host.docker.internal:8101/api/draft` and the draft server calls the CLI on the host.

`claude-api` runs inside Docker and calls the Anthropic API directly. It requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in **Settings → Authentication**. Use it when you do not have a subscription CLI available or when you want to avoid running the agent-runner process.

You can manage which backends are active in **Settings → Agents → LLM Providers** — each provider has a name, auth type (subscription/API/both), optional API key config, and step-by-step CLI setup instructions. Backends you disable are h
